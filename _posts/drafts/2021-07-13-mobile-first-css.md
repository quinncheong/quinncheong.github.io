After thinking long and hard, I have finally started a website to document my thoughts.

## Thoughts
1. Unsure of how I should release it to the public. Should I even release it to the public? Probably, so long as I can help a single person out there, lost in the storm. Am I scared of releasing it to the public, probably too. 

2. I might get lazy, and stop writing. 

3. This post probably isn't relevant, so move on and read my other writings. I'll end this semi-test here.

## Endnotes
Yes the site is pretty bad for now. Looks ok, is responsive, but lacks things like a contents page and more segregation + navigational tools for the reader. I'll get to it soon. Pardon me for now as Im still trying to fully grasp the concepts of liquid, Ruby and Jekyll. Its pretty easy, but at the same time the directories are giving me a little trouble. Will be working on it the coming weeks.
