Back in early 2021, I was considering applying for an in-semester internship. One particular startup, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.airvting.com/">airvting</a>, caught my eye. It got me thinking into what the future of E-commerce would be like, especially with the accelerated adoption of video and livestreaming due to Covid-19.

Introducing live-commerce, which is basically "shopping through video". It first came into mainstream media when Facebook and Amazon launched Facebook Live and Amazon Live. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to observe that live-commerce is on the rise and would probably play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital commerce - if it hasn't already. With the rise of TikTok, Huya, Instagram Live etc, its clear that big corporations understand the immense benefits of incorporating video into their core business processes. 

As we move towards a more immersive world, consumers are more demanding than ever. They expect quicker response times, higher quality goods, and faster delivery - sometimes anything that doesn't fall under 'next-day delivery' can be considered slow. You don't need me to show you how <a target="_blank" href="https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/us-brands-adopt-e-commerce-livestreaming-to-boost-sales/44218">successful</a> brands have been, ever since they moved from traditional brick-and-mortar shops to online shops, and now, live-commerce.

## What else can be done to live commerce

The question to ask should then be: "How can businesses move forward after integrating live-video?". Before I lay out solutions for businesses, we need to keep in mind some key principles. Finding the right solution is always a game of trade-offs, and we can follow the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a> in making decisions. Essentially, we're looking to drive the most growth with the least amount of input. Additionally, we want to find points of friction in the custoer lifecycle, and make the purchasing process as friction-less as possible. Taking into account these 2 key metrics, I propose 3 new integratable solutions for businesses to increase traction and streamline their customer acquisition model after integrating live-video into their business solutions.

1. Live-video x Shoppable Media
2. One-word-checkout model
3. Eye-tracking detection analytics

### Live-video x Shoppable Media

The most immediate, implementatble solution is cross-integrating live-commerce and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/opinion/what-the-shoppable-media-opportunity-means-for-brands/4095" >Shoppable Media</a>. Shoppable Media can be videos, images or interactive media forms which trigger transactions when a user clicks or interacts with the object. Gartner predicts both Live-Commerce and Shoppable Media to reach their plateau within the next 2-5 years. In the short run, these 2 have immense room for growth as they are still 'Adolescent', with a market penetration rate of about 5-20%. 

Live-commerce provides the interactivity that traditional e-commerce sites fail to do so, while shoppable media is a merchandising technique aimed at empowering brands to present their key products at key moments of the Consumer Journey, specially when consumers strongly desire the product. Shoppabel media boosts upsell of products and decreases friction because consumers can buy the product on the spot, instead of having to navigate away. The concept of immediate purchasing has been slowly adopted Shopee and Lazada with their 'buy now' button, and businesses should follow suit.

### One-word-checkout model

The one-word-checkout model is a play on words taken from Amazon's One-Click checkout patent. The core idea focuses on reducing friciton as much as possible, allowing consumers to purchase and checkout seamlessly. This solution would entail consumers to instantly purchase the merchandise from the viewer, without having to navigate away from the livestream. Let's take Facebook Live for example. FB Live is filled with blogshop owners who livestream and upsell through communicating with their customers via the stream and the comments section. The sellers 'verbally' answer questions posed in the comments (sellers also do reply in the comments as well), and the customers post what they want to buy in the comments. Once a seller has been 'confirmed', the host proceeds to send the link via a message. 

For the one-word-checkout model, we use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to filter out buyers that show a keen interest in purchasing, give sellers the power to 'push' popups onto the customer's screen, something similar to when one click's the "Buy Now" button on Shopee. Sellers can do so by reacting to the message sent by the user, or the messages which have been flagged by the Machine Learning (ML). We also allow buyers to activate the popup on their own by typing the word 'Buy' - followed by the specific parameters of the merchandise. E.g Color, model, size etc. 

This one-word-checkout model serves 2 main purposes. First, it drastically reducues confirmed-customer attrition, where confirmed customers are customers who would have bought the product but failed to do so because of unclear communication via DMs with the sellers, or because of adblocks or other forms of pop-up disablers which prevents a smoooth transaction process via Direct messaging (DMs). Second, it increases customer uptake because it allows businesses to identify key moments (by using AI) which customers will purchase the merchandise, and push a popup with some sort of incentive like a limited time discount. Because everything is done through the app itself, it not only reduces friciton but it also provides safety to the customers because customers are more trustworthy towards large companies, rather than unknown blogshops (to them) or small stores.

### Eye-tracking detection analytics

This is a longshot solution, but businesses should still keep a lookout for this, especially in the upcoming years as Augmented Reality (AR) and Virutal Reality (VR) become more commonplace and consumers are more comfortable in using and allowing access to their web cameras. Eye-tracking is what it sounds like, machines tracking gazes and pupil dilation etc. We use AI to output analytics which show how 'engaged' a user is based on how fast the eye shifts, and how engrossed the user is in watching the stream. This is an upgrade from mouse-tracking analytics because it induces an added degree of certainty, where we can extra sure that the user is indeed engrossed and participating in the livestream. 

To extend this even more, we should begin to look at livetime facial tracking analytics because it gives room to fully reveal the subconscious of the consumer, in ways that traditional sentiment analysis or mouse-tracking analytics would never be able to accomplish. 

## Final words

Live commerce is here to stay and the data shows that companies that don't fully embrace video will likely become industry laggards. We see the stagnation of Instagram, as Instagram is becoming somewhat like Facebook - Stale to the average consumer. We observe the rise in video-on-demand and also free-video providers such as artlist.io. It is evident that live-commerce can bring about widespread improvements to business, and business must learn to utilise it, or risk losing out.
