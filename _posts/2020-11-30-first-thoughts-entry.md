My first proper thoughts report on my goals and my plans.

Currently at Woodlands library and used the morning to catch up on goals and look at blogposts from others to get inspiration. 

Today I realised how far behind I am compared to the competition and how I need to work on my time management skills. Last week has been pretty great so far as I've finally got into a better routine and Im starting to really focus on goal setting for myself.

One thing that Im trying hard to work on is fixing my sleep schedule and trying to sleep 6h instead of 8++h a day. I know that gym and running might affect me since I now train 5x a week and run about 4x a week to lose weight. BW has been at 74.2kg this morning so that is a good sign.

I will have to make it a habit to not use my phone and turn off everything so that I can acheive the flow state / the zone as per what Csikszentmihalyi has advocated for.

Talked to Jiatong as well the previous night and seems like she really needs help for ANCOC in 2021. I promised not to go back anymore but I dont think I can say no to a long time friend and I mean I do kind of enjoy leadership development since my whole life for the past 10 years has been dedicated to leadership development.

Guess I might be going back to being a DM (finally?) and that might be ok because I've never done it before, technically, and its a good chance to catch up with old friends + meet some new faces.

Off to lunch for me.

### Goals for the rest of the year:
1) Complete 5 books in Dec

2) Instill in myself a solid day routine plan

3) Take a look at the big goals for 2021

4) Fix my sleep schedule
