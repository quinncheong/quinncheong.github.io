## Hello, I see you have chanced upon my personal notes.

I created this site to track my successes and failures from the adventures that I've had (and those that are to come). This site was founded in November 2020 as I started re-thinking upon my life and what I had been doing for the past year. I mainly write about my failures / successes, do book reviews and summaries on my best reads every month, blabber about Philosophy and questions that I've had since young, and maybe some other stuff that might be in my Private life.

Who knows? Certainly not me.

I try to be as objective and analytical as possible in my writings, and look at things from multiple perspectives. I welcome comments of all sorts, but whether or not I read them / reply to them, is up to fate. I implore you to look at my work with a tinge of liberality in you and I look forward to having some great conversations.

### **Some extra information**
I'll end it off with letting you know my 3 biggest beliefs, 3 things I hate, and 3 questions that I'm searching for an answer to.

### **3 Beliefs**
1) The 10 year goal. Work very hard for 10 years and reap the benefits. The first 8 years will kill you, but if you survive you come out a different person.

2) Look not at how to earn money, but how to make a difference in people's lives. The money will follow, but never get lost in it.

3) Hope. Beautifully dangerous, but yet we it is what drives us (me) to push my limits and hopefully, possibly, achieve great things. 

### **3 things I hate**
1) People who start giving advice to others on a whim when they don't have the proper experience. Don't give me insurance advice if you're 5 months into the trade. Don't teach me how to invest if you've not yet made it big yourself. 

2) Selfishness

3) Lamb / Goat based food.

### **3 Questions** 
1) What is the meaning to life? Are we born just so we can perish, or are we destined for greater things?

2) Does hard work REALLY trump everything else? Can one be certain that if he, regardless of background, works harder than the herd for the next 20 years, he will be guaranteed a shot a success?

3) Why is there so much hate in this world? Why has everyone been poulluted with jealousy and greed? Why are the successful able to look past these nonsensical, arbitrary desires and focus on the real thing?

> Life is a big, dark room, so big that its 1km by 1km, and so dark that no matter how hard you try, you cant see shit. However, there is a door. Some people are born closer to the door, but others, not so lucky. Keep walking, find the wall, and move, regardless of what it takes.
