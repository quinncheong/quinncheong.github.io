Back in early 2021, I was considering applying for an in-semester internship. One particular startup caught my eye, and the startup was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.airvting.com/">airvting</a>. It got me thinking into what the future of E-commerce would be like, especially with the accelerated adoption of video and livestreaming due to Covid-19.

Introducing live-commerce, which is basically "shopping through video". It first came into mainstream media when Facebook and Amazon launched Facebook Live and Amazon Live. As we move towards a more immersive world, consumers are more demanding than ever. They expect quicker response times, higher quality goods, and fast delivery - sometimes anything that doesn't fall with 'next-day delivery' can be considered slow. You don't need me to show you how <a target="_blank" href="https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/us-brands-adopt-e-commerce-livestreaming-to-boost-sales/44218">successful</a> multiple brands have been ever since moving from brick-and-mortar shops to online shops, and finally, now, live-commerce.
