### Hello, I see you have chanced upon my personal notes.

Im currently reading Information Systems at Singapore Management University. I do periodic full-stack development, with an interest in the future of Mixed Reality. I have also been interested in leadership theories, experiences and stories since I was a young kid. Additionally, I am passionate about changing education, and reverting back to the golden days where knowledge was king, instead of money. I've founded a few side projects on my own, hoping it will take off one day, or maybe just provide me wth some much-needed life lessons.

I created this site to track my successes and failures from the adventures that I've had (and those that are to come). This site was founded in November 2020 as I started re-thinking about my life and what I had been doing for the past year. I mainly write about my failures / successes, do book reviews and summaries on my best reads (periodically), blabber about doctrines and ways of life/philosophy, think about questions that I've had since young, and also analyse events that have happened in my Private life.

In my writings, I try to be as objective and analytical as possible, and I look at things from multiple perspectives. I implore you to look at my work with a tinge of liberality and I look forward to having some great conversations.

> Life is a big, dark room, and it's so dark that no matter how hard you try, you cant see shit. However, there is a door. Some people are born closer to the door, but others, not so lucky. Keep walking, find the wall, and move, regardless of what it takes.
